# ESP32 WiFi-Based Fog Detection Car

This repository contains the implementation of an **ESP32-based fog detection and WiFi-controlled robotic car**, developed as part of the **GE-107 course project** at IIT Ropar.

The system detects fog conditions using a **laser–LDR based visibility setup**, dynamically controls motor speed, and allows remote operation through a **WiFi-hosted web interface**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fog significantly reduces visibility and poses safety risks in autonomous and remotely operated vehicles.  
This project demonstrates a **fog-aware robotic car** that:

- Detects fog density using light attenuation
- Adjusts motor speed based on visibility conditions
- Alerts users via buzzer and LCD
- Allows real-time remote control over WiFi

- Laser + LDR based fog detection
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle distance estimation
- Dynamic speed regulation under fog conditions
- Buzzer alerts for reduced visibility
- LCD display for live system status
- WiFi-based control using a mobile-friendly web interface
- Safe shutdown handling when laser/system is turned off

## 🧠 Fog Detection Logic

Fog detection is based on **laser light attenuation**:

- High LDR value → Clear visibility
- Moderate drop → Light fog (speed limited)
- Severe drop → Dense fog (vehicle stopped)
- Very low reading → System/laser off (silent shutdown)

Thresholds are calibrated to ensure reliable detection and prevent false alerts.

## 🕹 WiFi Control Interface

The ESP32 hosts a **local WiFi access point** and web server:

- Mobile-friendly D-pad interface
- Supports Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop commands
- Low-latency control using HTTP requests

No external internet connection is required.
